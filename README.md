Project Euler
=============

What is Project Euler?
----------------------

> [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a
  series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts
  adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.

What is this repository about?
------------------------------

I decided to have a look on [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) recently and needed some tasks to tackle,
so I remembered Project Euler from my past student years and started solving problems from scratch in Elixir.

I'm trying to solve a problem or two each day, which is quite easy for now since I'm on a very early stage, 
but this might change in future. Hopefully I'll make it that far.

Is it OK if I just use it to pass my job interview?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, but remember: this won't help you to get through the probationary period. Also they are often sub-optimal,
so I'd strongly encourage you if not to make your own solution, then at least improve mine (pull requests are welcome!)
